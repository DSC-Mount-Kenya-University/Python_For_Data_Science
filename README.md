# Introduction

So, i have compiled this course to be as comprehensive and targeted as possible so that we can swiftly move towards Python for Data science and ML.
I have split it into 4 sections each with a good and detailed example opf what we are expected to cover.

#### T1_PYTHON

These are the bare bone basics of python.
This section includes

> VARIABLES
> FOR LOOPS
> WHILE LOOPS
> IF ELSE
> FUNCTIONS
> AN OPTIONAL TASK

---

#### T2_PYTHON II

This bundle includes all we've covered in:

> CLASSES
> DICTIONARIES
> LISTS
> MIXED DATA TYPES
> NUMPY ARRAYS
> SETS
> Please note that some of these we haven't covered but are usually what i mean when i say go read some more :-)
